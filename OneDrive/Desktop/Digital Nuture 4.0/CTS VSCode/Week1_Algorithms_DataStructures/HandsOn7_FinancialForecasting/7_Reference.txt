1. Recursive Algorithms
   Recursion is a problem-solving technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
   It simplifies complex problems by breaking them into simpler subproblems.
   Each recursive call reduces the problem size, eventually reaching a base case that terminates the recursion.

2. Setup
   In financial forecasting, we can use recursion to model the compound growth of a value over time.
   A recursive method can be used to calculate the future value by repeatedly applying the growth rate to the previous value.

3. Implementation Concept
   Formula for future value using compound growth:
   FutureValue(n)=FutureValue(n−1)×(1+r)
   Where:
      n = number of periods
      r = growth rate
      Base case: FutureValue(0) = initial value

4. Analysis
   Time Complexity:
      The naive recursive approach has O(n) time complexity (linear), as it makes one call per time period.
      If overlapping subproblems existed (like in Fibonacci), it could be exponential without memoization.

   Optimization Techniques:
      Memoization: Store previously computed results to avoid redundant computations.
      Dynamic Programming: Convert the recursive solution to an iterative one using tabulation.
