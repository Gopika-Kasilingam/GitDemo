1. Understand the Problem
   Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:
      Large inventories involve managing thousands of products efficiently.
      Proper data structures help in fast access, insertion, deletion, and search operations.
      Efficient algorithms reduce the processing time and improve system responsiveness.

   Suitable Data Structures:
      ArrayList:
         Good for storing and accessing elements in order.
         Slower for search, insert, or delete operations (O(n)).

      HashMap:
         Ideal for key-based access using productId.
         Offers constant-time complexity for add, update, and delete operations (O(1)) in average case.

2. Setup
   Create a new project and define a class Product with the following attributes:
      productId: Unique identifier for the product
      productName: Name of the product
      quantity: Available stock in the warehouse
      price: Cost per unit of the product

3. Implementation Concept
   Choose a Data Structure:
      HashMap<String, Product> inventory
         Use productId as the key for fast lookups and operations.

   Key Operations:
      Add Product: Insert a new product using its productId as key.
      Update Product: Replace the product object in the map if the productId already exists.
      Delete Product: Remove the entry from the map by its productId.

4. Analysis
   Time Complexity in HashMap (Average Case):

   | Operation | Time Complexity |
   | --------- | --------------- |
   | Add       | O(1)            |
   | Update    | O(1)            |
   | Delete    | O(1)            |
   | Search    | O(1)            |

	Optimization Tips:
      Use a HashMap for fast access via unique product identifiers.
      If frequent sorting or traversal is needed by name or quantity, consider using TreeMap (O(log n)) or maintain a separate sorted list.
      Avoid linear structures like ArrayList for search-heavy operations without indexing.
